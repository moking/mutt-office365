Subject: Question about the bitmap usage in dcd emulation patch

Hi Jonathan,

While reworking on the DCD emulation patches, I try to understand some
comments you added in the code in your tree.
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/blob/cxl-2023-09-26/hw/mem/cxl_type3.c?ref_type=heads#L2095
/*
 * TODO: Should only update the bitmaps after host has accepted the
 * change (except for forced removal). It will be necessary to
 * track offered but not accepted changes. Perhaps a shadow bitmap
 * will be needed for this.
 */

Currently, the bitmap update (set/clear) is done when processing qmp
operation, also you mentioned we may need separate bitmaps to track offered
    and accepted changes. I have two questions about this.
1. Why we need bitmap to track the offered changes? (FYI. In my latest change,
I added extent list to track pending add and pending release extents.)
2. If we only maintain a bitmap to track, we should track only accepted
extents, right? If so, we should update it in the add/release response command.

btw, I almost finished the rework and it is based on your cxl-2023-09-26
branch and is here:

Thanks,
Fan
