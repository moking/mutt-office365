Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Add workflow to test CXL dynamic capacity device

This patch series add support in kdevops to test cxl dynamic capacity
device (DCD) workflow.

Patch 1: add a qmp interface argument support so qemu can be launched
with qmp interface enabled, which is needed for function test like error
injection, dynamic capacity extent add/release.
Patch 2: add a new cxl topology to directly attach a DCD device under a
HB. The device has dynamic only capacity.
Path 3: add a new make command "cxl-create-dc-region" to create DC
region for dynamic capacity, which is needed before dc extents can be
added. We also fixed "make cxl" command as the regular cxl-mem-setup
worklfow does not work for dcd device.
Patch 4: add a new make command "cxl-dcd-setup" to add dc extents, and
convert dynamic capacity to system ram and online.

To sum up, to test DCD device, we have two alternate workflows,

First workflow:
After system bringup, run "make cxl" will create region, create dax
device and convert it to system ram. 

The other workflow:
After system bringup, and if ndctl is already available in the guest,
perform the following two steps:
1) make cxl-create-dc-region: create a region;
2) make cxl-dcd-setup: add dc extents, create dax device and convert it to
system ram.


Fan Ni (4):
  qemu: Add QMP connection option for QMP interface access
  CXL: Add a new topology to support DCD emulation
  CXL: Add support to create a DC region for DCD
  CXL: Setup DCD device as onlined system memory
