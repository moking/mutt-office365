Couple of reasons.
1) Don't allow a guest to accept extents it wasn't offered.
2) Don't allow them to be reallocated to someone else or offered again until release issued.
3) Reporting available extents (which is total - offered) (could use a count for this)

The one we use to return the extents list etc needs to be the one updated on
acceptance, and release response. But we need the other to ensure that
the action those commands indicate is a valid one.

Great -  Assuming I find time I want to add the FM-API side of things to
allow us to prove that bit out as well before plumbers.  Life / work gotten
a bit crazy recently so it might be on the Sunday in a hotel room ;)

Also we should talk about the Plumbers session.  I'm thinking we want to
focus only on in flight stuff + future directions.  A big part of that will
be DCD which I'm hoping you don't mind covering.  The future directions
side of things needs some brainstorming so we have some bullet points to kick
the discussion off around!   There is a session later on (mainly Ira + navneet
though I'm  down to introduce it) on the software stack on top.   We might
well lean on the fact we already introduced it in the QEMU session to save
time in that one!  (they have a long list of questions!)
