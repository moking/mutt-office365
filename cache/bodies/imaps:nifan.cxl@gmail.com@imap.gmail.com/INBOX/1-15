Hi Fan,

This is getting a bit technical, so if we want to go deeper should probably
do it on list (entity list compliance etc).

Sure. Don't mind what the data structure is as long as contains the information.
List may make more sense for this as not as perf critical + we care more about the
overall ranges rather than a simple mapping.  You may get fragmentation problems
though depending on how things are accepted (no need for them to be in order
I think?)

If the host doesn't respond, it's a bug on the host side and I think we
can use a force removal from fmapi side to recover them.
Otherwise if it wants none of them it should issue an
Add Dynamic Capacity Response with no extents. After which we can scrub the
list.  The flow indeed seems to rely on only one outstanding request or on the
host accepting them.  (that does seem dubious - we might want to query
that at SSWG).

For this direction I don't think there is a 'no I won't' response possible
so any extents could be released later and hence we need to keep them in
this list.

Sounds good but I think we should take the multiple add but host doesn't
accept them question to SSWG as that's nasty.

Sure - One thing to keep in mind is session is short and we want plenty of time
for questions / discussions, so we probably only want 10-12 mins of slides
that we actually want to talk about (can have some backup material or things
to leave on screen during discussions). Maybe half of that on DCD.
